# Formula 1 Fantasy 2024

I'm developing some code for picking fantasy team adjustments throughout the Formula 1 season.

Status March 12, 2024
I finally set this up as a repo to track my progress and have some github presence again.

The functions are in `weekend_functions.py`, and the function development and testing is in `weekend_scoring.ipynb`. The notebook `free_practice_assessment.ipynb` was initially used to assess the Free Practice results during a race weekend. I may revisit this eventually, but for now I'm focusing on accurately scoring the race weekend per the fantasy scoring structure, and then I will adjust this code to predicting scoring based on odds lines issued by DraftKings going into the weekend. This will eventually be used to forecast the best team composition ahead of the weekend for making the correct team changes going into the next race.
